It is my wholehearted belief that it is the UK's moral obligation to defend Mr Assange from extradition to the United States, whether it be from a moral, medical, or legal standpoint; His extradition is wrong from any perspective you may look at it, and it may become a precedent for trials against future journalists, news agencies, or whistleblowers.

Mr Assange's actions may have been harmful to the United States and it's Government, but it gave us an insight into the sheer amount of miscalculations and blunders committed by the inner workings of the - many of which were a crime in itself; for example, the 2007 Baghdad Airstrike, which killed at least 12 people, including 2 Reuters journalists - and injuring 2 children. And as the whistle blower Edward Snowden once said: "When exposing a crime is treated as committing a crime, you are being ruled by criminals"

We must also take into consideration Mr Assange's health and well-being, both physically and mentally. In fact, as you may already know, District Judge Vanessa Baraitser ruled against his extradition - due to her concerns over Mr Assange's health and mental well-being. And an extradition to the US would put Mr Assange's health and risk, possibly leading to his death. In fact, an extradition was once denied on this basis, as with the case of Gary McKinnon - which then Home Secretary Theresa may deemed as a suicide risk. Of course there is a notable difference; Gary McKinnon was a UK citizen. However, both Mr McKinnon and Mr Assange have Aspergers Syndrome, which the US will be less likely to accommodate for; sadly leading to a higher risk of Mr Assange taking his own life.

There also comes into question the fairness of the US legal system - as Mr Assange will most likely be put before a Jury in the eastern District of Virginia. The eastern District of Virginia has not been chosen as of random; it has been chosen due to its integral links to the intelligence community. The Jury is picked from a pool of locals, many of which are members of the US intelligence agency, throwing the chance of a fair trial out of the window.

With all of this in mind, I urge you to pressure the Home Secretary to prevent the extradition of Julian Assange, and if needs be, be put in front of a UK court. The Home secretary's decision in a few days will be detrimental to the future of journalism and freedom of information, the basis of modern day democracies.

I hope this email reaches you in time.

Many thanks,
