[Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/). The memory-efficient, fast, and reliable programming language. Designated as the future of programming - and the successor to C (and by extension C++), it was voted as the most loved programming language in the [Stack overflow 2021 survey](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2021#section-most-loved-dreaded-and-wanted-programming-scripting-and-markup-languages), being loved by nearly 87% of all respondents. Loved even more so by companies like [Firefox](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2017/08/inside-a-super-fast-css-engine-quantum-css-aka-stylo/) (its creator), [Dropbox](https://dropbox.tech/infrastructure/lossless-compression-with-brotli), [Cloudflare](https://blog.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-workers-as-a-serverless-rust-platform/), and is even to be [widely implemented](https://blog.torproject.org/announcing-arti/) in the TOR Browser, due to its inherent memory safety and state-of-the-art compiler.

This leaves many Rustaceans to wonder; Why isn't Rust implemented into the Linux kernel?

# Use in the Android Ecosystem
In April 2021, Google announced that Rust would be [implemented into the Android operating system](https://security.googleblog.com/2021/04/rust-in-android-platform.html), citing that memory safety bugs represent [approx. 70%](https://security.googleblog.com/2021/01/data-driven-security-hardening-in.html) of Android's high severity security vulnerabilities, meaning more time, effort, and effectively money is being spent on fixing errors which just would not have happened if C(++) was replaced with Rust. This pushed Google to become a major advocate of the use of Rust in the Linux kernel itself.

# The Linux community gives in.
And on the 6th of December 2021, Rust was [unceremoniously declared](https://lkml.org/lkml/2021/12/6/461) as Linux's second language, being the only major language alongside C present in the Kernel. Linus Torvalds commented that:
>Rust's primary first target seems to be drivers, simply because that's where you find just a lot of different possible targets, and you have these individual parts of the kernel that are fairly small and independent. That may not be a very interesting target to some people, but it's the obvious one.

He also expressed his worry over some Linux developers distain for the "Rustification" of the Linux kernel, adding:
>People complaining about 'Rustification' in userspace isn't a great sign for any future kernel use, but hey, we'll see. The kernel is different from userspace projects.

Senior Linux developer, Greg Kroah-Hartman, had this to say:
>Drivers are probably the first place for an attempt like this as they are the 'end leaves' of the tree of dependencies in the kernel source. They depend on core kernel functionality, but nothing depends on them.

And it seems this is the way forward. Starting with smaller, less critical components with the Linux kernel, the Rustification of Linux will slowly increase over time. Less of the rewrite people have been hoping for, but progress nonetheless.

A push for the Rustification of Linux has gained even more traction as of recent, following the upgrade from the C language standard - [C89](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_C), to the more "modern" [C11](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C11_(C_standard_revision)) standard in the Kernel, due to [potential security problems](https://lwn.net/ml/linux-kernel/20220217184829.1991035-1-jakobkoschel@gmail.com/) caused by C itself. This yet again raises the question; Why isn't Rust *further* implemented into Linux? For example, memory safety issues caused by C account for [two thirds of Linux kernel security holes [PDF]](https://static.sched.com/hosted_files/lssna19/d6/kernel-modules-in-rust-lssna2019.pdf), most of which could've been avoided if Rust had simply been used - accounting for a higher use of much-needed manpower, effort, and time; not to mention the security issues caused globally. And with Linux being trusted across the world for its steadfast, secure kernel - maybe it's time for more people to open up their arms to the future of programming, and long abandon decaying derelicts of the past.

Although, many developers see Rust as being "too bloated", a *major* issue with being implemented into the Linux Kernel. For example, a [survey from 2018](https://blog.rust-lang.org/2018/11/27/Rust-survey-2018.html#challenges) found that compile times were among the top 10 challenges Rust faced. But over the past 4 years, I believe the team at Rust have made incredible improvements in compile time, being one of their ["historical focus's of the Rust project"](https://blog.rust-lang.org/2022/02/15/Rust-Survey-2021.html#challenges-ahead), but also adding that "61% of respondents say work still needs to be done". But to give the compiler team credit, 61% (and me included) believe there has been an improvement over the past year, giving me even more hope for Rust's future success!

# Postscript
Progress is slowly being made. With the advancements of [Rust for Linux's](https://github.com/Rust-for-Linux) [fork of the Linux kernel](https://github.com/Rust-for-Linux/linux), perhaps it is only a matter of time before we close yet another chapter of Linux history, and move forward into the modern age. Perhaps it is even time for you, the reader, to pick up ["The Book"](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/) and contribute your part to the language revolution. With Rust having so many great tools over at [rust-lang.org](https://rust-lang.org/), learning a language has never been as easy, or as thought-provoking. Rust is perhaps one of my most adored languages of all time. It is both a challenge and an experience, and I encourage you to *at least* give it a go. It may not be your cup of tea, but I'm almost certain you'll come out of it having learnt something new, to possibly take further with you in your programming career. For me, the [Rustlings course](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings/) can help test your knowledge after the reading "The Book", especially if you have no projects you can implement Rust into yet. And if you're not so convinced, try out the [Rust Playground](https://play.rust-lang.org/); a compiler and an editor within your browser!

Please be sure to return to my blog also, as I will be writing much more about my adventures with Rust, Linux, and many other subjects!
