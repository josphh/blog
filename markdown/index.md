# About me
Hi, I'm Joseph; I am an open-source software advocate, believing in the ideals of a clutter-free web and free software. Furthermore, I extend this into my belief of individual liberty and freedom - including my support of the [EFF](https://www.eff.org/), the [FPF](https://freedom.press/) and other organizations alike. I'm a pretty dormant programmer, although I do enjoy understanding the concepts of new technology - and how I can work with them when I have time. One of these concepts is a technology called [IPFS (InterPlanetaryFileSystem)](https://ipfs.io/), which if you are using, you will notice my website is hosted on! Another one of these technologies is a programming language called [Rust](https://rust-lang.org). Whilst I have not made anything useful in the language so far, I aim to base a lot of my projects off of this language in the future.

I also use [NixOS](https://nixos.org/), a declarative operating system based off the Linux Kernel. It allows me to command exactly what my PC does, all within a few set files. It also allows me to back up my configuration to a Git server, meaning that if I were to use a new Computer, I could simply copy the file and build the config! Not only that, but it also means I'm able to revert to specific changes I made, in case I break anything.

If you haven't noticed, I share the same domain name with a friend of mine, [Daniel](https://danth.pwak.org). Daniel and I work together on ideas, and hopefully soon enough (when I have time) - software. Daniel is an incredibly skilled, helpfull, and intelligent programmer; and I advise you check out his page and his [GitHub](https://github.com/danth).

### GitHub

I'm [@josphh](https://github.com/josphh) on <templates-font-awesome style="brands" icon="github"></templates-font-awesome> GitHub, but I'm not very active, as you can see. And when I am, I barely finish the things I'm working on; for example - the now defunct [Quabbot](https://github.com/josphh/quabbot).

Here are my (very poor, I know) stats:
